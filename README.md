## AI-enhanced Mobile Robot for TESP 2017 (Work in progress)

Code for the robot developed with the Tohoku Space Robotics Lab during the Tohoku Engineering Summer Program 2017.

To use the Object Detection, you need to download the Tensorflow models repository (https://github.com/tensorflow/models). Then, place obj_recogn_chatbot.py inside models/object_detection.

All the nxt files require Python 2, while all the others require Python 3.
